Welcome to msprime's documentation!
===================================

This is the documentation for ``msprime``, a reimplementation of Hudson's
classical :command:`ms` simulator. For the initial beta release, only the
:command:`ms` compatible :ref:`command line interface <sec-cli>` is supported.
However, full documentation for the Python API and tree storage file format
are under development, and will be completed soon.
