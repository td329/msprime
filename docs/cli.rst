======================
Command line interface
======================

This is the documentation for the ``mspms`` program, an ms-compatible
command line interface to the ``msprime`` library.

.. note::

    **TODO:** Find good sphinx based method for documenting a CLI.
    We should be able to import the command line parser from
    the kingman package, and generated the documentaion from this.
